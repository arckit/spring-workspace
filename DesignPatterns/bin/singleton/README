Java Singleton Pattern

To implement Singleton pattern, we have different approaches but all of them have following common concepts.

    Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
    Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
    Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point for outer world to get the instance of the singleton class.
    
    In further sections, we will learn different approaches of Singleton pattern implementation and design concerns with the implementation.
